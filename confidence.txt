for confidence levels, z score
mean +-1.96 times sd =95% confidence
        1.645 times sd =90% confidence
        2.58 times sd=99% confidence

our best estimate of the exact value is 
    mean-(z fac)*stand error and
    mean+(z fac)*stand error to that % confidence

the significant dgits that match is what we can be sure of
